# Flipper Region Unlock

This app demonstrates a simple reversible region unlock, without any custom firmwares.

**This app is for educational purpose only! Do not use it for illegal activities!**

## How it works
The Flippers radio region is initialized on startup. This app is overriding the loaded region configuration with a fully unlocked region.

## How to use the app
1. Download/Clobe the source
2. Build it (see https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-ufbt)
3. copy it to your flipper

**I will not provide a prebuild binary. If you want to use it, you'll need to build it yourself.**
